# adventofcode
My submissions for advent of code. I only solve them sporadically, and tend to try to make things interesting if I can!

## 2021
For this year I finished a few solutions and realized I really liked using `awk` and `sed`! I then challenged myself to finish all of it using only those two tools. I then realized that they are great, but really cumbersome and though I would love to be a legendary bearded low-level operator... I'm not feeling it.

### Day 1
Not much to say here; a warmup puzzle and supremely suited for `awk`.
### Day 2
The built-in associative arrays in `awk` really helped here.
### Day 3
The trickiest one yet - especially puzzle 3b was really challenging as `awk` doesn't really allow for arrays to be passed as arguments to or return values from functions in a "modern" fashion. This took me embarrassingly long to finish because of the non-explicit type system.
### Day 4
This is about where I got bored using `awk` only. It's just really finicky with multi-dimensional arrays.

### Day 5

### Day 6
