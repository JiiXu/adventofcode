# adventofcode
My submissions for advent of code. I only solve them sporadically, and tend to try to make things interesting if I can!

## 2021
For this year I finished a few solutions and realized I really liked using `awk` and `sed` so I decided to challenge myself to finish the entire thing with just those two tools.

Every puzzle is also provided with a wrapper script.

### Day 1
Not much to say here; a warmup puzzle and supremely suited for `awk`.
### Day 2
The built-in associative arrays in `awk` really helped here.
### Day 3
The trickiest one yet - especially puzzle 3b was really challenging as `awk` doesn't really allow for arrays to be passed as arguments to or return values from functions in a "modern" fashion. This took me embarrassingly long to finish because of the non-explicit type system.
### Day 4


### Day 5
